# Wip3out Special Edition Beta Texturepack
  A texture pack for the PAL version of Wipeout 3 (SCES-02845 [Special Edition]), to be used with RetroArch and Beetle PSX HW (Vulkan)
  Needless to say, you need an ISO / CD Image of the game , RetroArch and a PC or device that supports Vulkan for the replacements to work.

#### INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
  Clone or download this repository as zip, extract or move the folder to the same place where your Wipeout 3 SE image is.
  After that, where it says imagename, rename it to be the same as the disc image name is on your PC, in my case, it is "Wipeout 3 - Special Edition (EU)-texture-replacements".
  Enable either RetroArch or Beetle PSX HW to use the Vulkan Renderer (Its in Core Options -> Renderer (Restart) -> Vulkan (Hardware)
  After that is done, close and open the Core again, go to the Core Options -> Video, then enable Track Textures and Replace Textures.
  Restart the core once again, and it should load the new textures!

#### CONTENTS
 The contents included here all comes from an official Wipeout 3 US demo, from the Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, issue #25. When i saw the demo had the old Assegai texture, i went digging, and found the other ships there aswell, along with audio files and other interesting stuff.
 The pack currently changes the following textures:
 - Ships
 - Ghost / Invisible ships
 - Team Colors on Menus
 - Low-Poly Ships (LODs)
 
 The plan for the future of the pack is to change the following:
 - UI Elements and colors (possible, but due to the textures being similar, i need someone which knows what textures to replace)
 - HUD Icons (some of them were different)
 - Fonts (the fonts had different colors, however, they lack some glyphs, i might re-color them later)
 - Ship concepts pack (Skins remade to look like the 3D concept ones, which had different colors from the ones used in the beta, despite having the same deisgn).
 - UI previews for the new colors
 - If other file replacements are possible, other stuff aswell? Who knows?
 - US and JAP version support (Possible, but im too lazy for that, if you want, make a push request with those replaced, and i'll make it public)
	 
#### CREDITS

 Psygnosis Leeds for the original game, Sony and Studio Liverpool for the assets, XentaX community for the PBP and CMP scripts used to see the textures, and the creator of TIMViewer for the tool to see the textures.
 Me for digging the resources, figuring out the tools, finding the ISO and checking that it indeed had all the other ship textures and assets included.
 
 If you wanna read about what could possibly be different back then, check out my article on TCRF here: https://tcrf.net/Proto:Wip3out_(Wipeout_3)
 
 I really hope more people make tools for Wipeout in the future. Its a worthy game to be preserved.
